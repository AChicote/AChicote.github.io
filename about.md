I have a robust training in mathematics, financial mathematics and in all regression and classification models used in Data Science. I like to feed my curiosity as a Data Scientist in evaluating and dissecting problems and delivering practical solutions while unveiling the mysteries hidden in the data. As a team player, I like to bring my passion, loyalty and commitment to my work and to those who worked with me.
