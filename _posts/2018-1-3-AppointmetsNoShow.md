title: Appointments NoShow
---
Why so many people do not show up for their medical approintments? Is it normal to have a 20% of noshows? Well, I though this was an interesting question, that deserve at least my atention because the impact that the no-shows have are not only for the miuses of resources that this implyies but also for the effect that this might have in the future in the health of those that did not show.
This is a study trying to predict if people will show up to their medical appointment.
