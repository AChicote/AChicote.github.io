title: Appointments NoShow
---
Why so many people do not show up for their medical approintments? Is it normal to have a 20% of noshows? Well, I though this 
was an interesting question that deserved, at least, my attention. I had to main reasons: the first one was the economic 
impact it has in the underemployment of public resources and, most importantly, the social cost that has in the patient, in
his/her family and in the future.

## Non-technical description of Appointments No-show study.

  1. ## Gathering the data.
 No pain, no gain and, I would add, no data no project. I obtained all the data from Kaggle and thanks to altruistics
 efforts. Every row in the file of 110k of them that I obtained was an appointment and for each appointment I had the 
 information listed under Appointments. Then, happily thinking that the weather would be a key factor, I scraped data 
 and added weather information to the mix for the days of the appointments.
